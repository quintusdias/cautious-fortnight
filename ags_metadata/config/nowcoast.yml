              - The ingest process for RTGSST involves converting from GRIB2 to GeoTIFF
                and reprojecting to Web Mercator (EPSG:3857). However, because the
                analysis is global, several problems have been encountered. Data gaps
                have been produced around the international dateline, problems with
                ArcGIS have arisen when the web mercator imagery goes beyond +/- 88
                degrees North/South, and x/y pixel resolution has produced noticeable
                inconsistency with the source data. To mitigate these problems, the
                following procedure was developed.
              - Convert GRIB2 message to *.flt/*.hdr (floating point raster).
              - Reproject *.flt/*.hdr raster to GeoTIFF in Web Mercator, using a chosen
                x and y pixel resolution that produces usable output.
              - Crop extent of raster to approximately +/- 88 degrees North/South
                (using meter coordinates), which is within the range supported by
                ArcGIS.
              - Clip land areas (set to NoData) using GDAL and an oceans polygon shapefile.
              - Generate overviews using gdaladdo to speed up performance at small
                scales.
              - The source files for SPoRT contain 8-bit  unsigned integer (byte)
                pixel values representing unscaled sea surface temperature values.
                Once retrieved, the GeoTIFFs are rescaled to 32-bit Floating Point
                GeoTIFFs representing SST in degrees Fahrenheit, assigned a NoData
                value, and are reprojected to Web Mercator before cataloging in the
                Mosaic Dataset.
              - The time coverage start of the SPoRT rasters is set to valid time
                minus the update frequency (e.g. 12 hours).
              - The time coverage end time of the SPoRT rasters is set to valid time
                plus a decided number of minutes. The number of minutes to add should
                be at least equal to product_delay + script_run_time + script_update_frequency.

                determine which time periods of data will be extracted from the MADIS

                which publishes land and maritime observations in separate shapefiles.
                NESDIS shapefiles are updated hourly, with the land observations available
                by approximately :15 minutes past the hour and the maritime observations
                available by approximately :25 minutes past the hour.  The data ingest
                routine can be configured to retain any number of hours of NESDIS
                data; each hour's land/maritime data will be stored in separate tables
                imported directly from the source shapefiles with no alterations to
                the attributes. Old shapefiles are deleted at the beginning of each
                run, and old tables are removed from the database once they pass the
                maximum retention age. If a shapefile has already been imported into
                the database, it is not downloaded again.

                from NESDIS are updated every hour. However, not all stations report
                that frequently. Many stations only report once per hour sometime
                between 15 minutes before the hour and 30 minutes past the hour. For
                these stations, new observations will not appear until approximately
                23 minutes past top of the hour for land-based stations and 33 minutes
                past the top of the hour for maritime stations.

                and "warnings", which reflect the naming conventions of the NWS Southern
                Region Headquarters (SRH) data providers.'
              - The warnings dataset consists of short-duration warnings including
                Severe Thunderstorm, Flash Flood, Special Marine, Extreme Wind, and
                Tornado Warnings.
              - The hazards dataset consists of all other watch/warning/advisory types
                (both short- and long-duration).
              - In addition to the primary hazards and warnings datasets produced
                by NWS SRH, Coastal and Offshore hazards for Alaska are processed
                separately by parsing the text forecasts for each zone. This is required
                because the SRH dataset is derived from VTEC and Alaska WFOs do not
                use VTEC for marine WWAs.
              - In order to combine both sets of hazards, it is assumed that the Alaska
                hazards are kept up-to-date by parsing the text forecasts on a set
                schedule and storing the results in its own tables (one for coastal
                and one for offshore Alaska WWAs). Then, when the primary (SRH) hazards
                product is updated, any features present in the Alaska tables will
                be pulled in to the primary table.
              - Because the warnings table only handles five types of WWAs and there
                are never more than a handful of active short-duration warnings at
                any time, no additional processing is done on the warnings dataset
                after importing and minor dataset cleaning/repairing. Conversely,
                the hazards dataset can be quite large, as often much of the U.S.
                is covered in one or more hazards and split into separate polygon
                features for each zone/WWA combination. For this reason, some extra
                processing is performed to the hazards dataset to ensure adequate
                performance in a map service.
              - After all new features have been imported into the primary hazards
                table and old features have been removed, hazards are split into individual
                tables using a categorical classification (e.g., maritime wind hazards,
                inland wind hazards, coastal flooding hazards, inland flooding hazards,
                snow/freezing precipitation hazards, etc.), each category being picked
                such that they can be grouped together in a single map layer. This
                not only improves performance by ensuring spatial indexes are managable
                and efficient, but also allows for the priority of each category to
                be adjusted in relation to one another, i.e. more important WWA categories
                can appear on top of less important ones.
              - Once the categorical tables have been updated, each table is then
                postprocessed with a "dissolve" operation to merge adjacent WWAs of
                the same type and time attributes. By performing a dissolve, many
                of the vertices present in the old polygons are dropped in favor of
                a single large polygon that covers the footprint of the original features.
                This is mainly done to improve performance of the map service, but
                can also improve graphical representation by not drawing the boundaries
                between zones and instead focusing on the entire WWA coverage area.
                However, the problem with the dissolve operation is that it does not
                allow unique attributes of each source polygon to be extracted into
                the dissolved table, which means that attributes like individual hazard
                URLs must be dropped. For this reason, and also because performance
                of the original categorical tables is often adequate, the dissolved
                tables are not presently used in the map services.

                features for each zone/WWA combination. For this reason, some extra
                processing is performed to the hazards dataset to ensure adequate
                performance in a map service.
              - After all new features have been imported into the primary hazards
                table and old features have been removed, hazards are split into individual
                tables using a categorical classification (e.g., maritime wind hazards,
                inland wind hazards, coastal flooding hazards, inland flooding hazards,
                snow/freezing precipitation hazards, etc.), each category being picked
                such that they can be grouped together in a single map layer. This
                not only improves performance by ensuring spatial indexes are managable
                and efficient, but also allows for the priority of each category to
                be adjusted in relation to one another, i.e. more important WWA categories
                can appear on top of less important ones.
              - Once the categorical tables have been updated, each table is then
                postprocessed with a "dissolve" operation to merge adjacent WWAs of
                the same type and time attributes. By performing a dissolve, many
                of the vertices present in the old polygons are dropped in favor of
                a single large polygon that covers the footprint of the original features.
                This is mainly done to improve performance of the map service, but
                can also improve graphical representation by not drawing the boundaries
                between zones and instead focusing on the entire WWA coverage area.
                However, the problem with the dissolve operation is that it does not
                allow unique attributes of each source polygon to be extracted into
                the dissolved table, which means that attributes like individual hazard
                URLs must be dropped. For this reason, and also because performance
                of the original categorical tables is often adequate, the dissolved
                tables are not presently used in the map services.

              - 'There are two main types of wwa''s currently processed here: "hazards"
                and "warnings", which reflect the naming conventions of the NWS Southern
                Region Headquarters (SRH) data providers.'
              - The warnings dataset consists of short-duration warnings including
                Severe Thunderstorm, Flash Flood, Special Marine, Extreme Wind, and
                Tornado Warnings.
              - The hazards dataset consists of all other watch/warning/advisory types
                (both short- and long-duration).
              - In addition to the primary hazards and warnings datasets produced
                by NWS SRH, Coastal and Offshore hazards for Alaska are processed
                separately by parsing the text forecasts for each zone. This is required
                because the SRH dataset is derived from VTEC and Alaska WFOs do not
                use VTEC for marine WWAs.
              - In order to combine both sets of hazards, it is assumed that the Alaska
                hazards are kept up-to-date by parsing the text forecasts on a set
                schedule and storing the results in its own tables (one for coastal
                and one for offshore Alaska WWAs). Then, when the primary (SRH) hazards
                product is updated, any features present in the Alaska tables will
                be pulled in to the primary table.
              - Because the warnings table only handles five types of WWAs and there
                are never more than a handful of active short-duration warnings at
                any time, no additional processing is done on the warnings dataset
                after importing and minor dataset cleaning/repairing. Conversely,
                the hazards dataset can be quite large, as often much of the U.S.
                is covered in one or more hazards and split into separate polygon

                such that they can be grouped together in a single map layer. This
                not only improves performance by ensuring spatial indexes are managable

          gmd:abstract: 'This nowCOAST map service provides maps depicting the latest
            official NWS Potential Storm Surge Flooding Map for any significant landfalling
            tropical cyclone expected to impact the Atlantic or Gulf of Mexico Coasts
            of the Contiguous United States. The map layers depict the risk associated
            with coastal flooding from storm surge associated with tropical cyclones.

            The Potential Storm Surge Flooding Map depicts the geographical areas
            where inundation from storm surge could occur along with the heights,
            above ground, that water could reach in those areas. These potential heights
            are represented with different colors based on water level: 1) Greater
            than 1 foot above ground (blue), 2) Greater than 3 feet above ground (yellow),
            3) Greater than 6 feet above ground (orange), and 4) Greater than 9 feet
            above ground (red). Two versions of this graphic are provided in this
            map--one with a mask (depicted in gray) identifying Intertidal Zone/Estuarine
            Wetland areas, and another version without the mask where Intertidal Zone/Estuarine
            Wetland areas are symbolized with the same colors as other areas.

            Two additional layers are provided to depict 1) the full geographic extent
            for which the Potential Storm Surge Flooding Map is presently valid (the
            "map boundary"), and 2) Levee Areas, if any, within the affected area
            (symbolized with a black-and-white diagonal hatch pattern).

            If the Potential Storm Surge Flooding Map is not presently active, all
            layers will be blank except for the Map Boundary layer, which will display
            a shaded region indicating the coverage area for any potential future
            graphics along with a text label indicating that the map is not presently
            available.

            This map service is updated approximately every 10 minutes on nowCOAST
            to ensure the latest information is provided to the user as soon as it
            becomes available. Once issued, the Potential Storm Surge Flooding Map
            will be updated by NHC every six hours alongside each new Forecast Advisory
            for the associated tropical cyclone. However, due to processing requirements
            during the creation of this product, the flooding map becomes available
            approximately 60 to 90 minutes following the release of the associated
            NHC Forecast Advisory, at which point nowCOAST will acquire it and update
            this map service within the next 10 to 20 minutes (i.e., this product
            will be updated on nowCOAST within approximately 70 to 110 minutes after
            the associated Forecast Advisory is released). For more detailed information
            about layer update frequency and timing, please reference the nowCOAST
            Dataset Update Schedule.

            Background Information: Developed by National Hurricane Center (NHC) over
            the course of several years in consultation with social scientists, emergency
            managers, broadcast meteorologists, and others, the Potential Storm Surge
            Flooding Map is intended to depict the risk associated with coastal flooding
            from storm surge associated with tropical cyclones. On June 1, 2016 it
            became an operational product, issued on demand for certain tropical cyclones
            that are expected to affect the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the United
            States. The product is not available for tropical cyclones that may affect
            coastal areas in the Eastern or Central Pacific regions.

              - The NHC and CPHC maintain several RSS "wallets" (five for the Atlantic,
                five for the Eastern Pacific, and five for the Central Pacific), any
                of which can contain information about a Tropical Cyclone Advisory
                at any time. If each of these feeds are empty, it indicates that there
                are no active Tropical Cyclones in either basin at the present time,
                in which case care is taken to erase all features currently stored
                in the database. However, for each wallet that contains information
                about an active system, several pieces of information must be parsed
                from the RSS file, including advisory issuance time, URL to the public
                advisory bulletin, name/number/basin of storm, and links to the 5-Day
                Track Forecast/Cone of Uncertainty/Watches and Warnings, Best Track
                (if any), and Forecast Information ZIP archives. Each of these archives
                contains a series of polygon, point and/or line shapefiles that must
                be ingested.
              - Because the map service that hosts these datasets is time-enabled,
                care must also be taken to correctly attribute time information. While
                time information may not be extremely critical for these products
                (since there will only be one set of data for each storm), the service
                is time-enabled mainly for consistency with other time-aware datasets,
                and because it affords flexibility in the future if it is wished to
                archive past track forecasts. Presently, the start time of all features
                related to an advisory is set to the advisory issuance time, while
                the end time is set to 5 days in the future (to correspond with the
                5-day advisory horizon).
