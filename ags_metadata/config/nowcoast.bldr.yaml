          The NWS/NCEP daily SST (1/12 deg) analysis is generated by the
          NCEP RTG_SST Analysis System using a two-dimensional variational
          interpolation scheme. The interpolation scheme uses the most
          recent 24-hours buoy and ship data and U.S. Navy SEATEMP (SST)
          retrievals derived from AVHRR data from the NOAA polar orbiting
          satellites. The first guess for the interpolation scheme is
          provided by the un-smoothed analysis from the previous day
          with a one-day climate adjustment. The analysis system was
          developed by the NWS/NCEP/Environmental Modeling Center/Marine
          Modeling and Analysis Branch.

          The NASA/SPoRT experimental SST Composite is a blend of the
          MODIS and NESDIS SST products except over the Great Lakes,
          where it is a blend of the MODIS and the United Kingdom Met
          Office (UKMO) Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea
          Ice Analysis (OSTIAS2). The NESDIS and OSTIAS2 products have
          spatial resolutions of 9 and 6 km, respectively. The compositing
          algorithm uses a seven-day collection of MODIS level-2B data and
          the most recent NESDIS GOES/POES SST Composite and OSTIAS2 daily
          products. Two types of weighting are used in the compositing
          process. One weight is for the data latency and the other for
          the product type. The MODIS data with a 1-km resolution is
          given the most weight. All available confidence flags and bias
          information are incorporated in the compositing process. The SST
          Composite is computed twice-daily (nighttime and daytime). The
          MODIS and OSTIA products are obtained in near-real-time from the
          GHRSST archive at NASA/JPL. The compositing system was developed
          by NASA Short-Term Prediction Research and Transition Center
          (SPoRT) Team.

          'The ingest process for RTGSST involves converting from GRIB2 to GeoTIFF and reprojecting to Web Mercator (EPSG:3857). However, because the analysis is global, several problems have been encountered. Data gaps have been produced around the international dateline, problems with ArcGIS have arisen when the web mercator imagery goes beyond +/- 88 degrees North/South, and x/y pixel resolution has produced noticeable inconsistency with the source data. To mitigate these problems, the following procedure was developed.', 
          'Convert GRIB2 message to *.flt/*.hdr (floating point raster).',
          'Reproject *.flt/*.hdr raster to GeoTIFF in Web Mercator, using a chosen x and y pixel resolution that produces usable output.',
          'Crop extent of raster to approximately +/- 88 degrees North/South (using meter coordinates), which is within the range supported by ArcGIS.',
          'Clip land areas (set to NoData) using GDAL and an oceans polygon shapefile.',
          'Generate overviews using gdaladdo to speed up performance at small scales.',
          'The source files for SPoRT contain 8-bit  unsigned integer (byte) pixel values representing unscaled sea surface temperature values. Once retrieved, the GeoTIFFs are rescaled to 32-bit Floating Point GeoTIFFs representing SST in degrees Fahrenheit, assigned a NoData value, and are reprojected to Web Mercator before cataloging in the Mosaic Dataset.',
          'The time coverage start of the SPoRT rasters is set to valid time minus the update frequency (e.g. 12 hours).',
          'The time coverage end time of the SPoRT rasters is set to valid time plus a decided number of minutes. The number of minutes to add should be at least equal to product_delay + script_run_time + script_update_frequency.'

      lineage_statement: >
          The maps of near-real-time surface weather and ocean
          observations are based on non-restricted data obtained from the
          NWS Family of Services courtesy of NESDIS/OPSD and also the NWS
          Meteorological Assimilation Data Ingest System (MADIS). The data
          includes observations from terrestrial and maritime observing
          stations from the U.S.A. and other countries. For terrestrial
          networks, the platforms include but are not limited to ASOS,
          AWOS, RAWS, non-automated stations, U.S. Climate Reference
          Networks, many U.S. Geological Survey Stations via NWS
          HADS, several state DOT Road Weather Information Systems,
          and U.S. Historical Climatology Network-Modernization. For
          maritime areas, the platforms include NOS/CO-OPS National
          Water Level Observation Network (NWLON), NOS/CO-OPS Physical
          Oceanographic Real-Time System (PORTS), NWS/NDBC Fixed Buoys,
          NDBC Coastal-Marine Automated Network (C-MAN), drifting
          buoys, ferries, Regional Ocean Observing System (ROOS)
          coastal stations and buoys, and ships participating in the
          Voluntary Ship Observing (VOS) Program. Observations from
          MADIS are updated approximately every 10 minutes in the map
          service and those from NESDIS are updated every hour. However,
          not all stations report that frequently. Many stations only
          report once per hour sometime between 15 minutes before the
          hour and 30 minutes past the hour. For these stations, new
          observations will not appear until approximately 23 minutes
          past top of the hour for land-based stations and 33 minutes
          past the top of the hour for maritime stations.
      process_steps: [
          'Each MADIS ingest execution will result in one or more new datasets being imported and all old datasets being dropped from the database. The current system time and the configured projections are used to determine which time periods of data will be extracted from the MADIS netCDF files, but no matter what time period is being processed, only the latest observation from a unique station record will be generated.',
          "Surface weather/ocean observations are also incorporated from NESDIS, which publishes land and maritime observations in separate shapefiles.  NESDIS shapefiles are updated hourly, with the land observations available by approximately :15 minutes past the hour and the maritime observations available by approximately :25 minutes past the hour.  The data ingest routine can be configured to retain any number of hours of NESDIS data; each hour's land/maritime data will be stored in separate tables imported directly from the source shapefiles with no alterations to the attributes. Old shapefiles are deleted at the beginning of each run, and old tables are removed from the database once they pass the maximum retention age.  If a shapefile has already been imported into the database, it is not downloaded again."

          Map Information

          This nowCOAST map service provides maps depicting the latest official NWS Potential Storm Surge Flooding Map for any significant landfalling tropical cyclone expected to impact the Atlantic or Gulf of Mexico Coasts of the Contiguous United States. The map layers depict the risk associated with coastal flooding from storm surge associated with tropical cyclones.

          The Potential Storm Surge Flooding Map depicts the geographical areas where inundation from storm surge could occur along with the heights, above ground, that water could reach in those areas. These potential heights are represented with different colors based on water level: 1) Greater than 1 foot above ground (blue), 2) Greater than 3 feet above ground (yellow), 3) Greater than 6 feet above ground (orange), and 4) Greater than 9 feet above ground (red). Two versions of this graphic are provided in this map--one with a mask (depicted in gray) identifying Intertidal Zone/Estuarine Wetland areas, and another version without the mask where Intertidal Zone/Estuarine Wetland areas are symbolized with the same colors as other areas.

          Two additional layers are provided to depict 1) the full geographic extent for which the Potential Storm Surge Flooding Map is presently valid (the "map boundary"), and 2) Levee Areas, if any, within the affected area (symbolized with a black-and-white diagonal hatch pattern).

          If the Potential Storm Surge Flooding Map is not presently active, all layers will be blank except for the Map Boundary layer, which will display a shaded region indicating the coverage area for any potential future graphics along with a text label indicating that the map is not presently available.

          This map service is updated approximately every 10 minutes on nowCOAST to ensure the latest information is provided to the user as soon as it becomes available. Once issued, the Potential Storm Surge Flooding Map will be updated by NHC every six hours alongside each new Forecast Advisory for the associated tropical cyclone. However, due to processing requirements during the creation of this product, the flooding map becomes available approximately 60 to 90 minutes following the release of the associated NHC Forecast Advisory, at which point nowCOAST will acquire it and update this map service within the next 10 to 20 minutes (i.e., this product will be updated on nowCOAST within approximately 70 to 110 minutes after the associated Forecast Advisory is released). For more detailed information about layer update frequency and timing, please reference the nowCOAST Dataset Update Schedule.

          Background Information
          
          Developed by National Hurricane Center (NHC) over the course of several years in consultation with social scientists, emergency managers, broadcast meteorologists, and others, the Potential Storm Surge Flooding Map is intended to depict the risk associated with coastal flooding from storm surge associated with tropical cyclones. On June 1, 2016 it became an operational product, issued on demand for certain tropical cyclones that are expected to affect the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the United States. The product is not available for tropical cyclones that may affect coastal areas in the Eastern or Central Pacific regions.

          'The NHC and CPHC maintain several RSS "wallets" (five for the Atlantic, five for the Eastern Pacific, and five for the Central Pacific), any of which can contain information about a Tropical Cyclone Advisory at any time. If each of these feeds are empty, it indicates that there are no active Tropical Cyclones in either basin at the present time, in which case care is taken to erase all features currently stored in the database. However, for each wallet that contains information about an active system, several pieces of information must be parsed from the RSS file, including advisory issuance time, URL to the public advisory bulletin, name/number/basin of storm, and links to the 5-Day Track Forecast/Cone of Uncertainty/Watches and Warnings, Best Track (if any), and Forecast Information ZIP archives. Each of these archives contains a series of polygon, point and/or line shapefiles that must be ingested.',
          'Because the map service that hosts these datasets is time-enabled, care must also be taken to correctly attribute time information. While time information may not be extremely critical for these products (since there will only be one set of data for each storm), the service is time-enabled mainly for consistency with other time-aware datasets, and because it affords flexibility in the future if it is wished to archive past track forecasts. Presently, the start time of all features related to an advisory is set to the advisory issuance time, while the end time is set to 5 days in the future (to correspond with the 5-day advisory horizon).',

          'There are two main types of wwa''s currently processed here: "hazards" and "warnings", which reflect the naming conventions of the NWS Southern Region Headquarters (SRH) data providers.',

          'In addition to the primary hazards and warnings datasets produced by NWS SRH, Coastal and Offshore hazards for Alaska are processed separately by parsing the text forecasts for each zone. This is required because the SRH dataset is derived from VTEC and Alaska WFOs do not use VTEC for marine WWAs.',
          'In order to combine both sets of hazards, it is assumed that the Alaska hazards are kept up-to-date by parsing the text forecasts on a set schedule and storing the results in its own tables (one for coastal and one for offshore Alaska WWAs). Then, when the primary (SRH) hazards product is updated, any features present in the Alaska tables will be pulled in to the primary table.',
          'Because the warnings table only handles five types of WWAs and there are never more than a handful of active short-duration warnings at any time, no additional processing is done on the warnings dataset after importing and minor dataset cleaning/repairing. Conversely, the hazards dataset can be quite large, as often much of the U.S. is covered in one or more hazards and split into separate polygon features for each zone/WWA combination. For this reason, some extra processing is performed to the hazards dataset to ensure adequate performance in a map service.',
          'After all new features have been imported into the primary hazards table and old features have been removed, hazards are split into individual tables using a categorical classification (e.g., maritime wind hazards, inland wind hazards, coastal flooding hazards, inland flooding hazards, snow/freezing precipitation hazards, etc.), each category being picked such that they can be grouped together in a single map layer. This not only improves performance by ensuring spatial indexes are managable and efficient, but also allows for the priority of each category to be adjusted in relation to one another, i.e. more important WWA categories can appear on top of less important ones.',
          'Once the categorical tables have been updated, each table is then postprocessed with a "dissolve" operation to merge adjacent WWAs of the same type and time attributes. By performing a dissolve, many of the vertices present in the old polygons are dropped in favor of a single large polygon that covers the footprint of the original features. This is mainly done to improve performance of the map service, but can also improve graphical representation by not drawing the boundaries between zones and instead focusing on the entire WWA coverage area. However, the problem with the dissolve operation is that it does not allow unique attributes of each source polygon to be extracted into the dissolved table, which means that attributes like individual hazard URLs must be dropped. For this reason, and also because performance of the original categorical tables is often adequate, the dissolved tables are not presently used in the map services.'
